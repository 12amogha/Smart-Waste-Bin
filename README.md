# Smart-Waste-Bin


We have designed a "SMART WASTE BIN "which consists of a servo motor which is integrated with a moisture sensor which helps open the lid of the bin when the moisture is dectected.We also have an ultrasonic sensor which is connnected to a buzzer which helps notify the user when the bin is full.

The purpose of our project is to provide a supervision device for the intelligent waste bin.This device integrates several sensors to supervise the state of the trash. Helps in efficient segregation of wet and dry waste.
